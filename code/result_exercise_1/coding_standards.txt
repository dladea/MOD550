Title: Assessment on Coding Standards on 3 different Github Repositories
Description: The assesment will be done in respect to 4 categories: Code Layout, Whitepace in Expressions and Statements, Comments, and Naming Conventions

Github 1: https://github.com/FoucauldE/CSC/blob/494148f94647e8a2d1f5101707c33f8333c85616/csc_lib/visualize.py#L4

1. Code Layout: 
- Indentation is consistent by using 4 spaces, 
- some lines are too long (more than 79 characters), like line 29.
2. Whitepace in Expressions and Statements**: Whitespaces are used consistently which is good for readability
3. Comments: 
- The use of comments is enough, 
- The function is missing docstring.
4. Naming Conventions: Naming conventions is followed well for file name, function, and variables

Github 2: https://github.com/noturlee/Titanic-DataModel/blob/main/DataSetTitanic/TitanicAnalysis.py
Accessed on February 3, 2025
1. Code Layout: Indentation is consistent by using 4 spaces and lines are not too long
2. Whitepace in Expressions and Statements: Whitespaces are used consistently which is good for readability
3. Comments: It does not have comments to explain the code
4. Naming Conventions: Variable names used are descriptive and follow the naming conventions

Github 3: https://github.com/scorpionhiccup/StockPricePrediction/blob/master/scripts/preprocessing.py
Accessed on February 3, 2025
1. Code Layout: 
- Indentation is consistent by using 4 spaces, 
- Import should usually be in separate lines, 
- Some lines are too long (more than 79 characters), like line 65.
2. Whitepace in Expressions and Statements: Whitespace is used consistently which is good for readability
3. Comments: 
- It does not have comments to explain the code, 
- The function is missing docstring.
4. Naming Conventions: Naming conventions is followed well for function and variables
